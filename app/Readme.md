# Hydroponics Control

Desktop app for the ESP32 hydroponics controller, native on **Windows (.exe) and Linux**. It talks
[contract v2](FirmwareContract.md) to the production firmware in this repository ([`../README.md`](../README.md), WP8 + WP9) over
**Bluetooth LE only**: data and settings go over the bonded Bluetooth link. The controller's own Wi-Fi is
only a setting on the Wi-Fi page (for future server publishing); the app never connects over Wi-Fi.

There is no server. The app keeps its own history and exports it. Run with `--demo` to use a built-in
simulator; no hardware is needed.

## Pages

- **Dashboard**: live values for the 10 metrics (BME280 air temperature, humidity and pressure;
  DS18B20 water temperature; light; water distance; pH; TDS; TVOC; CO2eq).
  - Each card shows how old the reading is, an indicative band and a 10-minute sparkline. A status label
    appears only when something needs attention (Warming up, Stale, Fault, Unpowered, Disabled…); normal
    readings, calibrated or not, carry no label.
  - Summary cards show the Bluetooth link, the power mode, the grow lamp (on/off and why), alarms and the
    number of samples recorded.
  - A latched alarm shows a banner with **Reset**. The reset is refused while the condition persists.
- **Connection**: Bluetooth scan, pairing with the passkey typed **in the app** (Linux and Windows),
  automatic reconnect without a passkey, Disconnect and Forget this controller.
- **Wi-Fi**: the controller's network status and sending SSID and password over Bluetooth. In low-power
  mode the controller switches Wi-Fi off until external power returns.
- **Metrics**: the history recorded on this computer.
  - Filters: controller, time range (1 h, 24 h, 7 days, all, custom) and metrics.
  - A summary table (latest, min, max, mean, sample count, % usable) and a trend chart.
  - **Download CSV** and **Download JSON**, with UTC timestamps. The JSON adds a `meta` block: node, firmware,
    boot ids, configuration revisions and the filters used.
- **Sensors**: the board's fixed sensors, with live health and an on/off switch.
  - The controller saves the change and confirms it once applied.
  - It refuses to switch off a sensor whose alarm is latched or active.
  - Side effects are shown before you confirm, for example "switching off light keeps the lamp OFF".
- **Calibration**: on-demand calibration of the sensors that need it, stored on the controller (see below).

The status bar always shows the controller, the Bluetooth link, whether state is stale, the power mode and
alarms. Power modes: **Normal power**, **Switching…**, **Low-power mode** (external 5 V lost: pH, TDS, water
level and Wi-Fi paused, the lamp relay off; Bluetooth and the 3.3 V sensors keep running), and **Power
transition degraded** (a step was not confirmed in time; check the controller).

### Calibration

Only the sensors whose reading depends on the individual probe are calibrated, and only when needed (new
probe, drift, or periodically for pH):

| Sensor | Procedure | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pH-4502C | Two buffers at least 1 pH apart (e.g. 7.00 then 4.00): rinse, immerse, let it settle ~1 min, **Capture** each | pH line, shown as **OK** instead of Uncalibrated |
| SEN0244 TDS | One reference solution of known ppm, with the water temperature probe in it, **Capture** | K-factor |
| DFR0026 light | A lux meter next to the sensor, type its reading and **Capture** at the same moment | value in **lux** instead of mV |

**Save calibration** sends the captured values with the reference values. The controller checks that the fit
is plausible (`bad_fit` otherwise), stores it in its flash, where it survives reboots and firmware updates,
and applies it from the next sample. **Reset to factory default** goes back to the firmware's default. The
lamp thresholds do not move when the light sensor is calibrated. Not calibrated here: BME280 and DS18B20
(factory-calibrated), SGP30 (learns its own baseline), HC-SR04 (reports distance).

### How data is recorded

- Every telemetry frame is recorded, whatever page is open.
- The controller has no clock. Sample time is the receive time minus the age the controller reports.
- The firmware samples every 1 s and sends a frame every 3 s, so **history resolution is about 3 s**.
- Each sample is stored once per (controller, boot, metric, sequence number), although frames repeat it.
- Samples without a usable value are kept with their health status. They export as an empty value (CSV)
  or `null` (JSON).
- Storage is SQLite in the user data folder:
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HydroponicsControlApp\Readings.sqlite3`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/HydroponicsControlApp/Readings.sqlite3`

  The v1 `Readings` table of older versions is left as it was.
- Wi-Fi passwords are never stored by the app.

## Run on Windows

Needs Python 3.10+ and a Bluetooth LE adapter (Windows 10 or 11).

~~~powershell
cd app
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r Requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python Main.py --demo
~~~

Leave out `--demo` to use the real controller. The first start downloads the Flet desktop client once.

**First pairing:**

1. Open the ESP's serial monitor and reset the board. It prints a six-digit passkey.
2. In the app, open **Connection**, choose **Scan**, type the passkey and choose **Connect**.

The app pairs through WinRT itself (`WinPairing.py`), so no Windows Settings dialog appears. bleak's own
`pair()` only supports "Just Works", which the firmware refuses. Later connections reuse the Windows bond
and need no passkey.

**Build the .exe:**

~~~powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_windows.ps1
~~~

The result is `dist\HydroponicsControl.exe`, one file with the plant icon (window, taskbar and file). It
installs `Requirements-build.txt` (PyInstaller) into `.venv` first. Check it with
`dist\HydroponicsControl.exe --demo`.

## Run on Linux (Ubuntu)

Needs Python 3.10+, BlueZ, a display session and the GTK runtime the Flet client uses:

~~~bash
sudo apt install python3-venv libgtk-3-0 libgstreamer1.0-0 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 libsecret-1-0 bluez
~~~

~~~bash
cd app
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r Requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python Main.py --demo
~~~

Pairing works the same way. The app registers a temporary BlueZ passkey agent (`BluezPairing.py`).

**Build the native Linux binary and launcher:**

~~~bash
./build_linux.sh --install
~~~

It builds `dist/HydroponicsControl` (one file, x86_64) in its own `.venv-linux`, then `InstallDesktop.py`
installs it with the plant icon and a GNOME launcher for the current user. PyInstaller does not
cross-compile: build on Linux (or WSL on a Windows PC), on the oldest distribution you want to run it on.
Without `python3-venv` the script installs into a pip-less venv with your user pip instead.

## One owner, and recovery

The controller accepts **one** bonded computer. To move to another computer, or after **Forget this
controller**:

1. Hold the ESP's **BOOT button for 10 s while it is running**. Not during reset: that enters download mode.
2. Pair again with the new passkey.

## Development

~~~powershell
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r Requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests
.venv\Scripts\python Main.py --demo --web 8551   # UI in a browser at http://localhost:8551
~~~

- **Tests:** they cover the protocol decoder and power modes, store dedupe and sample times, CSV/JSON export,
  and the session against the demo controller (Bluetooth reconnect without passkey, pH / TDS / light
  calibration and refused fits, low-power mode, and the refused disable while an alarm is latched).
- **Demo switches:** in demo mode, the Connection page has switches for Bluetooth going out of range, the
  external 5 V (low-power mode), a controller Wi-Fi outage and an over-temperature alarm.
- **Icons:** `python tools/make_icon.py` (needs Pillow) rebuilds `assets/AppIcon*` from
  `assets/source-icon.webp`, with the background made transparent.

## Limits

- After a lux calibration of the light sensor, recorded history holds mV samples before and lux samples after
  (the Unit column tells them apart). The Metrics summary, chart and Dashboard sparkline do not separate them:
  pick a time range after the calibration.
- Indicative bands are not crop advice. Set them for the real crop and calibrated sensors (`Meter.py`).
- The app reports what the controller says. It cannot prove the radio link's security properties.
  Production hardware also needs Secure Boot, Flash Encryption and a commissioning policy.
